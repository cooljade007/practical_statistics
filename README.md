# OVERVIEW

This project was focused on understanding and analyzing A/B Test Results. For this project, we worked on the results of a fictional company's e-commerce website.  This fictional company developed a new web page and is trying to determine it this new webpage would increase the number of users who "convert" (users who decide to pay for the company's product).
